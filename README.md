# P50
Heterogeneous Stock rats studied by Abe Palmer's P50 Consortium (NIDA funded)

I suggest we create one branch for each data type (16S, metabo, shallow shotgun, mixup) and the corresponding folder (16S, metabo, shallow shotgun, mixup) so that not all changes are at the same level and they can be reviewed separately for the different projects.
