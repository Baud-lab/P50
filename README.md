# P50
Heterogeneous Stock rats studied by Abe Palmer's first P50 Consortium (NIDA funded)

Several branches available, by data type:
Metabolomics (Joel and Loukia)
16S (Amelie)
shallow shotgun (Felipe)
allo-coprophagy (Helene and Felipe)

Corresponding folders also available so that when we later merge into the Master branch it's not a mess.
