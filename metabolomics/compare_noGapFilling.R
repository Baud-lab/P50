# here there is a case of having both 0s in unnormed, perfectly correlated values *and non perfectly correlated values*. 
# so some values borrowed from feature in original table (setA) and assigned to (slightly different) feature in gap filled table (setB)
# some values were 0 in original table and were "saved" to non 0 by gap filling 
# some values were perhaps borrowed from another feature in the original table (setA) and assigned to that feature in setB
# so those new setB features would be compound features in addition to being imputed. would need to be within MZ and RT range

#blue plot above shows that one feature has tons of 0s when the other one does not and for pairs of non 0 values,
#correlation is very high but not along diagonal (greater values for feature that has no 0s)
#looks like same true peak detected as two peaks but one falls below threshold for some samples
#"good" feature is MZ433.3313;6.8099, which used to give logP 11 QTLon chr14 but is further away in MZ from feature in gapFilling
#seems like feature in gapFilling table is centered on "bad" feature, which explains why I can't find the high logP peak.

#one feature (not the one that gave logP 11) took precedence when it came to gap filling - too bad
#black dots got imputed too - from where??
